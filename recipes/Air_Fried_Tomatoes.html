    <!-- Description of the food -->
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Air-Fried Italian Stuffed Tomatoes are a delightful and healthier twist on a classic Italian dish. Ripe, firm tomatoes are hollowed out to create a cavity for a savory filling, which typically includes a mix of Italian-inspired ingredients.</p>
    
    <p>The filling often features a combination of breadcrumbs, garlic, onions, and herbs like basil, oregano, and parsley. For added richness, grated Parmesan or mozzarella cheese is mixed in, along with optional ingredients like ground meat (such as beef or Italian sausage), sautéed spinach, or finely chopped vegetables like bell peppers or zucchini. Some variations include cooked rice or quinoa for a heartier texture.</p>
    
    <p>Once stuffed, the tomatoes are placed in the air fryer, where they cook at a high temperature. The air frying process makes the tomatoes tender while keeping their shape, and the filling becomes golden and slightly crispy on top, with the cheese melting into a gooey, flavorful layer.</p>
    
    <p>The result is a juicy, flavorful tomato with a perfectly cooked, aromatic filling. These Air-Fried Italian Stuffed Tomatoes are often garnished with fresh basil leaves, a sprinkle of additional Parmesan, and a drizzle of olive oil or balsamic glaze. They can be served as an appetizer, side dish, or light main course, offering a delicious taste of Italy with a modern, healthy twist.</p>
