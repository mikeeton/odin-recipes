    <!-- Description of the food -->
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Mediterranean Stuffed Zucchini is a delicious and vibrant dish that features zucchini boats filled with a flavorful mixture inspired by Mediterranean cuisine. The zucchini are hollowed out, creating a "boat" shape, and then stuffed with a savory filling that typically includes ingredients like ground meat (such as lamb, beef, or turkey), tomatoes, onions, garlic, and a blend of Mediterranean herbs and spices like oregano, thyme, and parsley.</p>
    
    <p>The filling often includes additional components such as rice or quinoa, pine nuts, and raisins or currants for a touch of sweetness. Some variations might also add crumbled feta cheese, olives, and sun-dried tomatoes to enhance the Mediterranean flavors</p>
    
    <p>Once stuffed, the zucchini are baked until tender, and the filling is cooked through, often topped with a drizzle of olive oil and sometimes a sprinkle of fresh herbs or lemon zest for added brightness. The dish is colorful, aromatic, and rich in flavors, making it a perfect light yet satisfying meal or side dish.</p>

    <!-- steps -->
    <h2>Direction</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Step 1</strong> <br> <p>Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).</p></li>
        <li><strong>Step 2</strong> <br> <p>Use a melon baller to separate and remove seeds and pulp separately from the zucchini, carving out each half and leaving about a half-inch shell. Chop zucchini pulp into pieces about 1/4 inch in diameter. Discard seeds.</p></li>
        <li><strong>Step 3</strong> <br> <p>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir onion and garlic in hot oil until tender, about 5 minutes. Add ground lamb; continue to cook and stir until lamb is lightly browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir chopped zucchini into the lamb mixture. Reduce heat to medium-low. Simmer mixture until the zucchini is hot, about 3 minutes. Drain excess grease. Season lamb mixture with coarse salt and black pepper.</p></li>
        <li><strong>Step 4</strong> <br> <p>Remove skillet from heat. Stir tomato sauce, tomatoes, feta cheese, pine nuts, and 1/4 cup mint leaves through the lamb mixture; spoon into the zucchini halves. Put stuffed zucchini halves into a large baking dish. Pour water into the baking dish.</p></li>
        <li><strong>Step 5</strong> <br> <p>Bake in preheated oven for 30 minutes. Mix bread crumbs and mozzarella cheese in a bowl. Sprinkle 1/4 cup mint leaves over the zucchini and top with the bread crumb mixture. Continue baking until the top is crusty and browned, about 10 minutes more.</p></li>
