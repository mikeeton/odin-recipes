    <!-- Description of the food -->
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Grilled Stuffed Poblanos are a smoky and flavorful dish that showcases poblano peppers filled with a delicious, savory stuffing and then grilled to perfection. Poblano peppers, known for their mild heat and slightly earthy flavor, are the star of this dish. They are typically roasted or charred first to soften the skin and enhance their natural smokiness.</p>
    
    <p>After roasting, the peppers are carefully slit open, and the seeds and membranes are removed to create space for the stuffing. The filling can vary widely but often includes a mixture of ingredients like seasoned ground meat (such as beef, turkey, or chorizo), black beans, rice, onions, garlic, and tomatoes. Mexican-inspired spices like cumin, chili powder, and cilantro are commonly used to add depth and warmth to the flavor.</p>
    
    <p>Cheese is a key component, with varieties like cheddar, Monterey Jack, or queso fresco often mixed into the filling or sprinkled on top. Some versions also include corn, diced jalape√±os for extra heat, or a touch of lime juice for brightness.</p>

    <p>Once stuffed, the poblanos are grilled over medium heat until the peppers are tender, the filling is heated through, and the cheese is melted and bubbly. The grilling process adds a charred, smoky flavor that complements the spicy and savory stuffing. The dish is often garnished with fresh cilantro, avocado slices, sour cream, or a drizzle of salsa for a fresh and tangy finish. Grilled Stuffed Poblanos can be served as a main course or a hearty side dish.</p>

    <!-- steps -->
    <h2>Direction</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Step 1</strong> <br> <p>Prepare an outdoor grill for indirect grilling, lighting burners on just one side or pushing lit coals to one side. Preheat to medium-high heat (375 to 400 degrees F (180 to 200 degrees C)). Lightly oil grill grates over lit side.</p></li>
        <li><strong>Step 2</strong> <br> <p>Grill poblanos and corn, covered, turning occasionally, until poblano skins and corn are charred, about 10 minutes. Keep grill lit.</p></li>
        <li><strong>Step 3</strong> <br> <p>Transfer poblanos to a large bowl, cover, and let stand for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, let corn stand until cool enough to handle; cut kernels from cobs.</p></li>
        <li><strong>Step 4</strong> <br> <p>Remove and discard poblano skins, keeping stems intact. Make a lengthwise slit down one side of each poblano, starting at stem and being careful not to cut through to other side. Remove and discard seeds and membranes.</p></li>
        <li><strong>Step 5</strong> <br> <p>Stir together beans, corn kernels, cilantro, oregano, garlic, salt, cumin, and black pepper in a large bowl. Spoon about 1/2 cup bean mixture into each pepper, enclosing pepper around the filling.</p></li>
        <li><strong>Step 6</strong> <br> <p>For the cheese sauce, melt butter in a small saucepan over medium-low heat; whisk in flour. Cook, stirring until lightly browned, 1 to 2 minutes. Whisk in milk; simmer, stirring, until slightly thickened, 2 to 3 minutes. Gradually whisk in cheese until melted. Remove from heat and keep warm, stirring occasionally.</p></li>
        <li><strong>Step 7</strong> <br> <p>Lightly oil grill grate over unlit side of grill. Grill stuffed poblanos, covered, until filling is heated through, 5 to 7 minutes.</p></li>
        <li><strong>Step 8</strong> <br> <p>Serve immediately with cheese sauce; pico de gallo; and (if using) cilantro, lime wedges, and/or radishes. Garnish with chili powder.</p></li>
