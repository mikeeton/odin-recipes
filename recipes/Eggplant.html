    <!-- Description of the food -->
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Stuffed Eggplant, also known as "Imam Bayildi" in some Mediterranean and Middle Eastern cuisines, is a hearty and flavorful dish where eggplants are hollowed out and filled with a savory mixture. The eggplants are typically cut in half lengthwise, and the flesh is scooped out to create a "boat" that can hold the filling.</p>
    
    <p>The filling varies by region but often includes a mixture of saut√©ed vegetables like onions, tomatoes, bell peppers, and garlic, along with ground meat such as beef, lamb, or turkey. Herbs and spices like cumin, paprika, oregano, and parsley are commonly used to enhance the flavor. Some variations include rice or bulgur, nuts like pine nuts or walnuts, and even raisins for a sweet contrast.</p>
    
    <p>In vegetarian versions, the filling might be made entirely of vegetables, herbs, and grains, often accompanied by a generous amount of olive oil and sometimes topped with cheese like feta or Parmesan.</p>
    
    <p>After being stuffed, the eggplants are usually baked until tender, allowing the flavors to meld together. The final dish is rich, aromatic, and full of contrasting textures, with the soft, tender eggplant complementing the robust and flavorful filling. It's often served as a main course or a substantial side dish, garnished with fresh herbs or a squeeze of lemon juice for added brightness.</p>
