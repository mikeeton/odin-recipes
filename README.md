# Odin Recipes

This project is part of The Odin Project curriculum and serves as a practical demonstration of basic HTML skills. In this project, I will create a simple recipe website that will contain a main index page with links to a few recipes.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Structuring HTML documents
- Using basic HTML elements like headings, paragraphs, lists, and links
- Organizing content with proper semantic elements
- Creating links between multiple pages
